## Vision

Hydro is a relaxing exploration-puzzle game where the player will be absorbed in a mystichal world under the water.
The user is meant to be astonished and amused by beautiful landscape and ethereal creatures and deeply annoyed by all the junk that there will be in the waters breaking the harmony of those magical lands.
The aim of this is to make the player realize, at a certain point, how wrong it is to throw every tipe of junk in the environment.
The controls for Hydro are different from the usual: the user will not be moving directly Hydro but he will have control over the flow of water.
Hydro will be moved by the currents just like a jellyfish.
Another core feature of the game is how the world is organized: the world is basically a sliced 3D world and the player will have the possibility to move inside a slice or to change slice.
